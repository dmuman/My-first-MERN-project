That's my first attempt to build a MERN application. I'm just following tutorials on YouTube.
For now functionalities are:
- Sign up (registry);
- Sign in (login);
- Forgot password (will send you an email with the link to create a new password) (work is still in process).

***TODO:***
- Log out;
- Admin page/dashboard with the info about all the users. Admin can change their info;
- Personal page for every user with possibility to change your info;
- Main page (I still have to decide what project will it be. Maybe I'll just add the navigations etc., and will be developing separated project with futher functionality);
- **Maybe**, just ***maybe***, try to implement basic *bootstrap* styles.

  And the ***main TODO***  - is just learn React, Node, Express and Mongo. And, especially, JavaScript. I'm a total nubie in it for now.
  Whoever read this - I love you. If you struggle - do not give up. I'll try to not give up too. Hope, there will be more projects.

  ***Huge hugs!***
